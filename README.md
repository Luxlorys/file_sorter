# file_sorter

This project was created for one reason - I'm tired of sorting files with different extensions into other folders.

For example -> i have a folder "Downloads", which stores different files (such as images, documents, etc.), also i have folders "Pictures", "Documents" and etc.
where i want to store particular files (.jpeg / .png -> Pictures folder), so this app will do it for me
